# **FoodieDelight**
FoodieDelight is a restaurant management application built with React v18, Jest, and JSON Server for API data mocking. This project allows an admin to add, update, delete, and search for restaurants. The application utilizes React Router DOM for routing and is styled using Bootstrap and Material-UI. JSON Server is used for mocking API data, and Axios is used to fetch data from the server.

## **Features**
1. **Add, Update, Delete Restaurants:** Easily manage restaurant entries through a user-friendly interface.
2. **Search Functionality:** Quickly search for restaurants by name.
3. **Routing:** React Router DOM is used for navigation between different pages.
4. **Styling:** The app is styled using Bootstrap and Material-UI to provide a clean and responsive UI.
5. **Mock API:** JSON Server is used to mock API data, making it easy to test and develop without a backend.
6. **Axios Integration:** Axios is used for making HTTP requests to fetch and manipulate data.
